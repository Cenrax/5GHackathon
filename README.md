### Socket.IO Audio

The audio from the app is streamed to the Socket.IO server (```Node.JS```) for continuous real-time speech-to-text recognition.

The server uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to detect when the user started saying something and when s/he has stopped speaking. The chunks of audio are then streamed continuously to DeepSpeech model (```TensorFlow```), which is a model based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper. When the user has finished speaking, the detection is then finished and the result is processed to detect which actions should be performed. The detected actions are then returned to the app.

### Socket.IO Video
